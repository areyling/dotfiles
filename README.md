# dotfiles

My personal collection of settings, scripts and other customizations. [Read more here]( http://andrewreyling.com/2013/09/04/dotfiles-disappearance-and-doing/).

## install

Still a work in progress. See topic directories for individual installers.

## what's inside

Yes.

Other than that, check out the README file in some subdirectories for more information about that particular topic.

## bugs

[The README.markdown](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/blob/master/README.markdown) in [Holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) says it best:

> I want this to work for everyone; that means when you clone it down it should
> work for you even though you may not have `rbenv` installed, for example. That
> said, I do use this as *my* dotfiles, so there's a good chance I may break
> something if I forget to make a check for a dependency.
>
> If you're brand-new to the project and run into any blockers, please
> [open an issue](https://github.com/areyling/dotfiles/issues) on this repository
> and I'd love to get it fixed for you!

## thanks

Some of this is my own, some is just my own adaptation and some may be copies collected throughout the years with the attribution lost. Recognize something? Thanks! Let me know and I'll give credit accordingly...
